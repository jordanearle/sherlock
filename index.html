    <p class="maintext"><span class="boldtext">Sherlock Holmes</span> is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan
                        Doyle. Known as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for a proficiency with
                        bservation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he
                        employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.
                        Amongst other foibles, Holmes had a penchant for papier maché.</p>

    <p class="maintext">First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became
                        widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with
                        "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then to 1927, eventually
                        totalling four novels and 56 short stories.</p>

    <p class="maintext">All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian periods, taking place between about 1880
                        to 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson,
                        who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him
                        at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.</p>

    <p class="maintextlight"><span class="boldtext">Dr John H Watson</span> is a medical doctor, formerly in the
                            British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is arguably the only friend and
                            confidant of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

    <p class="maintextlight">In the debut Holmes story A Study in Scarlet, Watson, as the narrator, describes
                            meeting Holmes, their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street,
                            his attempts to discover the profession of his taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual
                            taking of Watson into his confidence, and the events surrounding their first case together.
                            Watson describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner for Holmes'
                            taste. In time, they become close friends. </p>

    <p class="maintextlight">In The Sign of Four, John Watson met Mary Morstan, who became his wife. Mary seemed
                            somewhat less sure of her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him "James" in the short
                            story "The Man with the Twisted Lip". This may be a simple typographical error, though
                            some have speculated that it is a wifely reference to Watson's unknown middle name, which
                            could have been "Hamish" (Scottish for "James") Dorothy Sayers, creator of the detective
                            Lord Peter Wimsey, also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later published
                            this theory in Unpopular Opinions.</p>

  <p class="maintextlight2"><span class="boldtext">Professor James Moriarty,</span> the arch-enemy of the famous
                            Detective Sherlock Holmes, a mathematics professor turned the world's only consulting
                            criminal. His genius is equal to, if not perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.</p>

  <p class="maintextlight2">He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly
                            all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract
                            thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre
                            of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each
                            of them. Sherlock Holmes speaking of Moriarty to Watson.</p>

  <p class="maintextlight2">Despite only appearing in two stories, Moriarty has been proven to be the most dangerous
                            of all criminals that Holmes has ever encountered. In the short story "The Adventure of
                            the Final Problem", during a fight with Holmes above the Reichenbach Falls, Moriarty fell
                            to his death.</p>

                                                    is a brilliant dominatrix who has an apparently romantic attraction
                                                    to Sherlock Holmes.</p>

    <p class="maintextlight">Whilst Mycroft is telling Sherlock about Irene, he states that she is a dominatrix who
                            gives out 'recreational scolding' to people. She has been in the middle of two political
                            scandals in recent years, one of them involving a famous author, in which she had an affair
                            with both sides.</p>

    <div class="irenephoto">
      <img class="irene" src="img/irene.jpg">
    </div>

    <p class="maintextlight">She is brought to Sherlock's attention when he and John are summoned to Buckingham Palace
                             by Mycroft and are asked to take on a case of national importance. Irene had taken
                             compromising images of a young female member of the British Royal family during a
                             dominatrix session.</p>

    <p class="maintextlight">Even though Irene does not want money or power for the pictures, Sherlock is tasked
                             in getting them back. She is using them, and other information on her mobile phone,
                             for her "protection".</p>

    <p class="maintextlight">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's celebrated Holme's characters have lived a life beyond the
                             printed page. Guinness World Records has listed Holmes as the "most portrayed movie
                             character", with more than 70 actors playing the part in over 200 films. It has also been
                             estimated that Sherlock Holmes is the most prolific screen character in the history of
                             cinema.</p>

    <p class="maintextlight">Recent adaptations, brought to life on the silver screen, include Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman's portrayal in <a class="linkwhite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)">Sherlock</a>, Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu in <a class="linkwhite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_(TV_series)">Elementary</a> and – more recently – Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal in <a class="linkwhite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Holmes">Mr Holmes.</a></p>
